# General Info

This is an **experimental work in progress**, and it is being developed primarily for personal use; however, I figure as the project matures
it may become relevant to othersâ€™ personal projects and may become useful.

# What It Can Do

Best to just check the commits for the most up-to-date info. As of right now, all that this utility can do is conjugate 
1st conjugation, active voice verbs.  The output is JSON.

# Roadmap

Ideally, this utility will grow to the point where it can do the following:

* Conjugate all verbs based on conjugation rules specified in JSON.
* Inflect other Latin words (in order of priority: nouns, adjectives and adverbs)
* Provide formatted output of the inflections via a format config file (most likely a .json file with various options).
 
Once again, this project is mainly for personal use, because I need a fast method for inflecting words and outputting to
a template in a manner where I won't make mistakes doing this manually.
