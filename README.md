# General Info

This is an **experimental work in progress**, and it is being developed primarily for personal use; however, I figure as the project matures
it may become relevant to others’ personal projects and may become useful.

# What It Can Do

Best to just check the commits for the most up-to-date info.  Right now, this tool can:

* Inflect all verb regular conjugations (including 3rd conjugation —iō, defective, and deponent verbs)
* Provide JSON output for said inflections

# Roadmap

Ideally, this utility will grow to the point where it can do the following:

* Conjugat irregular verbs
* Inflect other Latin words (in order of priority: nouns, adjectives and adverbs)
* Provide formatted output of the inflections via a format config file (most likely a .json file with various options).
 
Once again, this project is mainly for personal use, because I need a fast method for inflecting words and outputting to
a template in a manner where I won't make mistakes doing this manually.
